# MHDR Priest Spammer

Full blown auto-clicker program for a game that barely anyone I know plays that'll only be used by the creator themselves.

Just download the `.exe` file. It'll automatically create a json file to save keybinds so it's better to put this in a dedicated folder. Need setup for first launch.

Only works for keyboard playstyle, use custom mode to use your own keybinds (it has my own keybinds built in because **I** made it).


How it works:
1. Hold down basic attack key, called `activation key` in program
2. Keybinds are spammed as long as you hold basic attack
3. Spam delays are customizable
4. Keybinds are only customizable in `Custom Mode`, change activation key via `Key Settings`
